# ACES-For-Blender
I made an installation and uninstallation script for Blender ACES
## About ACES:
ACES is a color management system that is used in the film industry. It is a set of tools and standards that help to ensure that the colors in a film are consistent and look natural.
In a nutshell, it's a cool thing.

## About ACES in this installer:
 - 1.2
 It's just a 1.2 version of ACES, the removes blender's default color management system.
 - 1.3 Pro
 It's a 1.3 version of ACES, the comes with blender's 4.1 default color management system.
 - 1.3 Pro Modified
 It's a 1.3 version of ACES, the comes with blender's 4.3 default color management system. WIP

P.S I don't remember where I downloaded the original ACES files, so I can't provide a link.
